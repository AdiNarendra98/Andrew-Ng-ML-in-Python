## About
If you've finished the amazing introductory Machine Learning on Coursera by Prof. Andrew Ng, you probably got familiar with Octave/Matlab programming. With this repo, you can re-implement them in Python, step-by-step, visually checking your work along the way, just as the course assignments.

## How to start
This repository is my implementation of the assignments.They have been uploaded both in python and jupyter notebook format for your convinience.

## About
This repositry contains the python versions of the programming assignments for the [Machine Learning online class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) taught by Professor Andrew Ng. This is perhaps the most popular introductory online machine learning class. In addition to being popular, it is also one of the best Machine learning classes any interested student can take to get started with machine learning. An unfortunate aspect of this class is that the programming assignments are in MATLAB or OCTAVE, probably because this class was made before python became the go-to language in machine learning.
If you've finished the amazing introductory Machine Learning on Coursera by Prof. Andrew Ng, you probably got familiar with Octave/Matlab programming. With this repo, you can re-implement them in Python, step-by-step, visually checking your work along the way, just as the course assignments.

## Requirements 

These assignments has been tested and developed using the following libraries: 

    - python==3.6.4
    - numpy==1.13.3
    - scipy==1.0.0
    - matplotlib==2.1.2
    - jupyter==1.0.0
    - jupyter-client==5.0.1
